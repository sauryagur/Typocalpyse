## 🧨 What is Typocalypse?
Typocalypse is a cursed browser extension that takes everything you type and lovingly ruins it.  
Think **autocomplete**, but instead of helping, it channels unhinged AI energy to derail your thoughts into glorious chaos.  

It’s not practical. It’s not financially viable.  
It’s the *perfect* hackathon project. 🚀

## ✨ Features
- **Wandering Cursor** → Moves around as if it has free will.  
- **Chaotic Autocomplete** → Detects common phrases and “finishes” them with LLM-powered nonsense.  
- **Uncorrecting Auto-Correct** → Fixes words you didn’t misspell. Then un-fixes them.  
- **Ghost Writer Mode** → Random text appears as if your computer is haunted.  
- **Chaos Level Slider** → Choose between *slightly annoying* and *total keyboard Armageddon*.  
- **Infinite Biz Model™** → The more unusable it becomes, the more fun it is.
