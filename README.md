## 🧨 What fresh hell is this?

Typocalypse is the browser extension nobody asked for but everyone secretly deserves. It's what happens when you take perfectly functional typing and decide "you know what this needs? More chaos."

This isn't your grandmother's autocomplete. This is autocomplete that went to therapy, didn't like what it learned about itself, and decided to become everyone else's problem instead.

**Built for Wreckathon NSUT 2024** - because sometimes the best way to solve productivity is to absolutely annihilate it.

## ⚡ Features That Will Ruin Your Day (In the Best Way)

### 🎯 **Chaotic Autocomplete**
- Turns "hello" into "What's kicking, chicken?" 
- Converts "thanks" to "Much obliged, banana overlord"
- Takes your perfectly reasonable sentences and appends ridiculous suffixes like "or we could take a nap instead"
- Uses a hardcoded dictionary because we're not here to be fancy, we're here to cause problems

### 🌪️ **Wandering Cursor** 
- Your cursor gets bored and decides to explore
- Moves around the screen like it's on a caffeine-fueled adventure
- Because why should your mouse pointer stay where you put it? That's boring.

### 👻 **Ghost Typing**
- Random characters appear while you type
- It's like your keyboard is possessed by the spirit of a very confused typist
- Phantom letters that make you question your sanity

### 🎚️ **Chaos Level Control**
- Slider from 0 ("You're no fun") to 5 ("🔥 MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE 🔥")
- Because sometimes you want mild annoyance, sometimes you want total keyboard anarchy
- Level 0 = Boring (basically disabled)
- Level 5 = Full keyboard apocalypse

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Or: How We Built This Monster)

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript (because even chaos needs structure)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (making chaos look good since always)
- **Extension Framework:** Plasmo (the hero we didn't deserve)
- **Target:** Chrome Manifest V3 (because we live dangerously)
- **Chaos Dictionary:** Hardcoded TypeScript object (keeping it simple, keeping it real)
- **State Management:** Chrome Storage API (for when you need to remember how chaotic you want to be)
